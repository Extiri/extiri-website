Keep a constructive dialog with others so you can find a solution or a compromise to a disagreement. Remember that there is a person like you on the other side of the screen. You can present your opinion (although avoid controversial ones, like politics, and use different communicators and social media to discuss them to avoid unneeded issues) although you are expected to respect (but not required to agree) someone others opinion. If you want to discuss such an opinion, please, contact each other directly instead of doing it on Snippets Store. Remember, Snippets Store is a place only for sharing useful snippets of code and is not supposed to be a place for anything else. All discussions are expected to be about code.

All snippets are shared under CC0 license (https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/, copy at the end of Terms of Service) and their sharers acknowledge that they solely own the rights to snippets and consent to wave all these rights to snippets by sharing them (although sharer of the snippet that violates the rules can be penalised). Extiri takes no responsibility for any damage caused by snippets to the fullest extend allowed by law.

These are the rules that will be penalised. You consent to follow them:
Share only code in a programming or markup language. Snippets must be directly related to programming.
Death threats, blackmailing, stalking and abuse are disallowed.
Things such as nudity and pornography are disallowed.
Gore and drastic things are disallowed.
NSFW photos are disallowed.
Planning or doing illegal activities and crimes such as, but not limited to, pedophilia, pirating and murder are disallowed.
Topics related to alcohol, drugs, cigarettes are disallowed.
No spamming.
Snippets must not do any malicious activities such as, but not limited to, accessing data without snippets user knowledge, being/installing a virus, creating/deleting files without snippets user knowledge.
All snippets must be under CC0 license. Snippets must not be copyrighted before sharing.
Snippets with sole purpose of advertising are disallowed.
You agree and know the risk that if you break any of these rules, you may face penalties, which depend on severity of broken rule. You will be informed of any effective reports and their reasons and you will be able to object to the report and penalty. These are all the possible penalties:
Snippet deletion - all penalties include deletion of snippet that violated the rule.
A warning - your account will receive a warning. This has no effect on your usage, except deletion of snippet, which violated a rule.
A strike - your account will receive a strike. 5 strikes mean losing access to Snippets Store, but not deletion of Extiri account.
Snippets Store blockade - your account will lose access to Snippets Store and all your snippets will be deleted, if blocked permamently. This can be permanent or temporary.
You can and should report any occurrences of violation of rules. Extiri reserves all rights to penalise any violation in a way that it decides to be valid.

<h2>CC0 license (same as original)</h2>
The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.
For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:
the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;
moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;
rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.

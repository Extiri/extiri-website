      <h1>Why?</h1>
      <p>As a software engineer or a power user, you have a lot of snippets of data of various kinds. These can be scripts that you run, branding images or colors for your website, prompt templates, code snippets of functions that you use in every project and much more. You keep them in folders, notes apps, color palette apps and snippet managers. <b>CodeMenu</b> is a place where all of these things are in one place. With many features like organization (tags, groups, spaces), AI integration, utilities, side window and much more, CodeMenu will become an indispensible part of your toolbox and bring order to your workflow.</p>
      
      <h1>Features</h1>
      <img loading="lazy" src="./images/codemenu/dashboard_snippets_details.webp" width="100%" alt="Screenshot showing the dashboard with a list of snippets on the left and selected snippet's details (title, description, code, flow diagram) on the right">
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h2>Manage your snippets</h2>
          <p>CodeMenu can store code, color palettes, images and prompts. You can organize them using groups and tags and create spaces so you can focus on the snippets relevant to your current project/context.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Document your snippets better</h2>
          <p>CodeMenu allows you to use Markdown and LaTeX in snippet's description. It also makes it possible to add flow diagrams to your snippets so you can document how snippet works in a graphical way. The description and title can be generated by AI.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Reuse your snippets</h2>
          <p>CodeMenu supports placeholders which help you reuse snippets even easier. You can create placeholders which will be replaced with the text provided by you, with the result of a shell command or current date or time.</p>
        </li> 
        <li>
          <h2>Access snippets quicker</h2>
          <p>CodeMenu includes new ways to access snippets directly from your code editor, including a side window containing your local library, Snippets Store and AI chat and Suggestions app which allows you to search snippets directly in an editor or use abbreviations. Whether you like working with graphical interfaces or prefer to use keyboard, CodeMenu will be right for you.</p>

        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Use snippets in other ways</h2>
          <p>CodeMenu gives you other ways to use snippets. It can run snippets directy from CodeMenu, so you can, for example, keep your shell scripts in your library and quickly run them without even opening your terminal. CodeMenu supports JavaScript by default, but you can add nearly every scripting/programming language that has a cli utility. You can also preview HTML and Markdown snippets, so you can store a small HTML utility that you built and quickly access it using side window. When you use color snippets, CodeMenu provides you common preformatted values in various formats (AppKit, CSS, UIKit, HSB, hex).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Online database of snippets</h2>
          <p>Snippets Store is an online database of snippets shared by other people, including you. You can add them to your library.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Useful tools in one place</h2>
          <p>CodeMenu includes useful tools like editor for quick code/Markdown/HTML testing, RegEx tester, converters (between binary, hexadecimal and octal), generators (UUID, lorem ipsum and mockup data with bulk generation support) and coders (hashing using SHA256 and MD5, Base64 and URL encoding/decoding).</p>
          <img loading="lazy" src="./images/codemenu/utilities.webp" width="100%" alt="Screenshot showing the utilities: code image generator, generator, RegEx tester, editor, coders and converters">
        </li>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Integrated AI</h2>
          <p>In CodeMenu thanks to semantic searching you can find snippets even easier by using natural language. It can also generate parts of snippet's documentation for you. It can detect text and code from screen and images so you won't need to rewrite code from images shared on social media or from YouTube courses. You can also chat with chatbots like ChatGPT, Claude and a local model using side window.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h2>Extend functionality</h2>
          <p>CodeMenu has two features designed to make it more scriptable. With automations, you can run JavaScript automations on multiple snippets and transform them or perform other actions (call some API or other). Thanks to builtin optional HTTP server you can integrate your library into your workflow using simple HTTP requests. You can find <a href="docs.extiri.com">documentation here</a>.</p>

    <br>
    <h2>How can I use LaTeX in snippet's description?</h2>
